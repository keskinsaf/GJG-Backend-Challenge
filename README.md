**DEEP NOTE**: This project is not deployed to server yet, I tried it but it was a little bit challenging for me and I am extremely busy for 2 weeks and only could spend 1 day for coding and half day for deploying, but deploying part did not go well. So, this project is not completed yet, but I am sharing this project with you, because I will not have enough time to complete deployment and documentation for next at least 2 weeks.
